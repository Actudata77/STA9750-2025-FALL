## Data Integration and Initial Exploration



### Extra Credit Opportunity #01: Relationship Diagram

The diagram below summarizes the structure of the datasets used in this project and the relationships among them.

![](images/diagram2.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

Each dataset in this project represents a distinct source of information related to housing affordability, and the diagram above shows the logical connections among them.

- **ACS Tables — INCOME, RENT, POPULATION, and HOUSEHOLDS:**  
  These datasets share the geographic identifier `GEOID` and the variable `year`.  
  These common keys allow one-to-one joins, aligning indicators such as median household income, monthly rent, population size, and number of households for each metropolitan area and each year.

- **PERMITS (Building Permits Survey):**  
  Uses the `CBSA` code to identify the same metropolitan areas.  
  While `CBSA` and `GEOID` are not identical, they represent equivalent regional boundaries and can be cross-referenced to connect new housing construction data with ACS demographic measures.

- **WAGES (Bureau of Labor Statistics):**  
  Uses the `FIPS` code to identify regions and includes variables for total employment, total wages, and average annual wage by industry (`INDUSTRY`).  
  Each `INDUSTRY` code link has a detailed description in the **INDUSTRY_CODES** table.

- **INDUSTRY_CODES (Lookup Table):**  
  Provides hierarchical industry classification labels that map the numeric codes in the WAGES dataset to descriptive names.

Put together, all these relationships show how multiple data sources with different identifiers (`GEOID`, `CBSA`, `FIPS`) and time references (`year`) can be integrated.  
Although the data are not fully normalized—some relationships, we have enough to study how income, rent, housing supply, and wage dynamics interact across U.S. metropolitan areas over time.

### Multi-Table Questions

**1.Which CBSA (by name) permitted the largest number of new housing units in the decade from 2010 to 2019 (inclusive)?**

```{r}
largest_cbsa <- PERMITS %>%
  filter(year >= 2010 & year <= 2019) %>%
  group_by(CBSA) %>%
  summarize(total_permits = sum(new_housing_units_permitted, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_permits)) %>%
  left_join(HOUSEHOLDS, by = c("CBSA" = "GEOID")) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  select(NAME, total_permits)

highlight <- function(x) {
  paste0('<span style="color: darkred;"><b>', x, '</b></span>')
}
```

The CBSA that permitted the largest number of new housing units in the decade from 2010 to 2019 (inclusive) is `r highlight(largest_cbsa$NAME)`, which permitted `r highlight(largest_cbsa$total_permits)` new housing units.

**2.In what year did Albuquerque, NM (CBSA Number 10740) permit the most new housing units?**

```{r}
  housing_permits<- PERMITS %>%
    filter(CBSA == 10740) %>%
    arrange(desc(new_housing_units_permitted)) %>%
    slice(1) %>%
    select(year, new_housing_units_permitted)
```
Abuquerque, NM (CBSA Number 10740) issued the most new housing units in the year of `r highlight(housing_permits$year)`, for a total of `r highlight(housing_permits$new_housing_units_permitted)`.

**3.Which state (not CBSA) had the highest average individual income in 2015? To answer this question, you will need to first compute the total income per CBSA by multiplying the average household income by the number of households, and then sum total income and total population across all CBSAs in a state. With these numbers, you can answer this question.**

```{r}
   library(stringr)
  
  INCOME %>%
    filter(year == 2015) %>%
    mutate(state = str_extract(NAME, "., ([A-Z]{2})", group = 1)) %>%
    left_join(HOUSEHOLDS %>% filter(year == 2015) %>% select(GEOID, households), 
              by = "GEOID") %>%
    mutate(total_income = household_income * households) %>%
    group_by(state) %>%
    summarize(total_income = sum(total_income, na.rm = TRUE),
              total_households = sum(households, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    mutate(avg_individual_income = total_income / total_households) %>%
    arrange(desc(avg_individual_income)) %>%
    slice(1) %>%
    select(state, avg_individual_income)
```

**4.Data scientists and business analysts are recorded under NAICS code 5182. What is the last year in which the NYC CBSA had the most data scientists in the country? In recent, the San Francisco CBSA has had the most data scientists.**


```{r}

library(dplyr)

# Filter WAGES data for data scientists (NAICS 5182) first
wages_filtered <- WAGES |>
  filter(INDUSTRY == 5182) |>
  mutate(std_cbsa = paste0(FIPS, "0"))

# Filter POPULATION data and prepare for join
population_filtered <- POPULATION |>
  mutate(std_cbsa = paste0("C", GEOID))

# Join the datasets on std_cbsa and year
data_scientists <- wages_filtered |>
  inner_join(
    population_filtered |> select(std_cbsa, NAME, year),
    by = c("std_cbsa" = "std_cbsa", "YEAR" = "year")
  )

# Group by year and CBSA to find which had the most data scientists
ds_by_year <- data_scientists |>
  group_by(YEAR, NAME) |>
  summarise(total_employment = sum(EMPLOYMENT, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |>
  group_by(YEAR) |>
  slice_max(total_employment, n = 1) |>
  ungroup() |>
  arrange(desc(YEAR))

# Find the last year NYC had the most data scientists
last_nyc_year <- ds_by_year |>
  filter(grepl("New York", NAME, ignore.case = TRUE)) |>
  pull(YEAR) |>
  max()


# Filter to show only NYC area rows
nyc_only <- ds_by_year |>
  filter(grepl("New York", NAME, ignore.case = TRUE))
print(nyc_only)
```

The last year in which the NYC CBSA had the most data scientists in the country was `r highlight(last_nyc_year)`.

**5. What fraction of total wages in the NYC CBSA was earned by people employed in the finance and insurance industries (NAICS code 52)? In what year did this fraction peak?**

```{r}
#  Step 1: Filter WAGES data before joining
wages_filtered <- WAGES |>
  mutate(std_cbsa = paste0(FIPS, "0"))

# Step 2: Filter POPULATION data and prepare for join
population_filtered <- POPULATION |>
  mutate(std_cbsa = paste0("C", GEOID)) |>
  filter(grepl("New York", NAME, ignore.case = TRUE))

# Step 3: Join to get NYC data only
nyc_wages <- wages_filtered |>
  inner_join(
    population_filtered |> select(std_cbsa, NAME, year),
    by = c("std_cbsa" = "std_cbsa", "YEAR" = "year")
  )

# Step 4: Calculate total wages by year for NYC
total_wages_by_year <- nyc_wages |>
  group_by(YEAR) |>
  summarise(total_wages = sum(TOTAL_WAGES, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Step 5: Calculate finance and insurance (NAICS 52) wages by year for NYC
finance_wages_by_year <- nyc_wages |>
  filter(INDUSTRY == 52) |>
  group_by(YEAR) |>
  summarise(finance_wages = sum(TOTAL_WAGES, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Step 6: Join and calculate the fraction
finance_fraction <- total_wages_by_year |>
  inner_join(finance_wages_by_year, by = "YEAR") |>
  mutate(fraction = finance_wages / total_wages) |>
  arrange(YEAR)


# Find the year with the peak fraction
peak_year <- finance_fraction |>
  slice_max(fraction, n = 1)

```

The fraction of total wages in the NYC CBSA earned by people employed in the finance and insurance industries The fraction of total wages in the NYC CBSA earned by people employed in the finance and insurance industries peaked in the year `r highlight(peak_year$YEAR[[1]])`, with a fraction of `r highlight(round(peak_year$fraction[[1]] * 100, 2))`%.

### Initial Visualizations

**1. The relationship between monthly rent and average household income per CBSA in 2009 using ggplot**
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
income_rent_2009 <- INCOME %>%
  filter(year == 2009) %>%
  inner_join(RENT %>% filter(year == 2009), by = c("GEOID", "year"))
ggplot(income_rent_2009, aes(x = household_income, y = monthly_rent)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Monthly Rent vs. Average Household Income (2009)",
       x = "Average Household Income",
       y = "Monthly Rent") +
  theme_bw()
```



**2. The relationship between total employment and total employment in the health care and social services sector (NAICS 62) across different CBSAs. Design your visualization so that it is possible to see the evolution of this relationship over time.**

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

#  Step 1: Filter WAGES data for healthcare (NAICS 62) before joining
healthcare_wages <- WAGES |>
  filter(INDUSTRY == 62) |>
  mutate(std_cbsa = paste0(FIPS, "0")) |>
  group_by(std_cbsa, YEAR) |>
  summarise(healthcare_employment = sum(EMPLOYMENT, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Step 2: Calculate total employment by CBSA and year
total_employment <- WAGES |>
  mutate(std_cbsa = paste0(FIPS, "0")) |>
  group_by(std_cbsa, YEAR) |>
  summarise(total_employment = sum(EMPLOYMENT, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Step 3: Join healthcare and total employment data
employment_data <- total_employment |>
  inner_join(healthcare_wages, by = c("std_cbsa", "YEAR")) |>
  inner_join(
    POPULATION |> mutate(std_cbsa = paste0("C", GEOID)) |> select(std_cbsa, NAME, year),
    by = c("std_cbsa" = "std_cbsa", "YEAR" = "year")
  ) |>
  mutate(healthcare_share = healthcare_employment / total_employment)

ggplot(employment_data, aes(x = total_employment, y = healthcare_employment, color = YEAR)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, alpha = 0.3) +
  facet_wrap(~YEAR, scales = "free") +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Total Employment and Healthcare Employment by CBSA",
    subtitle = "Evolution over time across different years",
    x = "Total Employment (log scale)",
    y = "Healthcare & Social Services Employment (log scale)",
    color = "Year"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )

```


**3. The evolution of average household size over time. Use different lines to represent different CBSAs. For each plot, make sure your final visualization is publication-ready and equipped with, at a minimum.**

- Proper x and y-axis axis labels
- A meaningful title
- Proper units for axis ticks (if appropriate)
- Proper legend titles (if appropriate)
- Proper font sizes so that all text is legible.

## Building Indices of Housing Affordability and Housing Stock Growth

We will begin by constructing an initial metric of rent affordability by combining our INCOME, RENT, and POPULATION tables from above. Using a suitable join, we merge these three into a single table which can be used to perform the following task.

### Rent Burden

**Standardization:** Define a baseline value around which your metric is centered.  
Some possible baseline structures may include:

- Setting 0, 50, or 100 to the long-term national average  
- Setting 0, 50, or 100 to the national average in the first year of your study  
- Setting 0 to the lowest value and 100 to the highest value in the study

  select(GEOID, NAME_income, year, household_income, monthly_rent) |>
  rename(NAME = NAME_income)

# Step 2: Calculate basic rent-to-income ratio
# Annualize monthly rent and compute ratio
rent_burden_raw <- rent_burden_raw |>
  mutate(
    annual_rent = monthly_rent * 12,
    raw_rent_to_income = annual_rent / household_income

# Step 3: Calculate national baseline (long-term average across all years and CBSAs)
national_baseline <- rent_burden_raw |>
  summarise(mean_rent_to_income = mean(raw_rent_to_income, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  pull(mean_rent_to_income)

cat("National baseline rent-to-income ratio:", round(national_baseline, 4), "\n\n")
