<p>We handle the missing values straight in the import phase in the <code>read_tsv</code>. We can see that missing values are format the way R wants it to.</p>
<p>After viewing the head and tail of the data, we want to just gain better sense of the data. For that let’s chose a random number of rows other than the head or tail of the data by using the sample function to select random rows.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stranger-things-a-global-phenomenon-returns-for-final-season">Stranger Things: A Global Phenomenon Returns for Final Season</h3>
<p>According to a 2025 Collider ranking, Season 4 of Stranger Things is widely regarded as the strongest of the first four seasons , this sets the tone for the highly anticipated final season arriving later this year. Stranger Things has really proven to be a truly global phenomenon. In the United States alone, it held a place in the Top 10 for 16 weeks, while internationally it achieved even greater staying power: 24 weeks in Ukraine, 23 weeks in Pakistan, 21 weeks in India, and more than a dozen weeks across European and African markets including Belgium, France, Kenya, and Nigeria. Compared to other popular English-language TV shows such as Wednesday and The Crown, Stranger Things remains one of Netflix’s most dominant hits. Globally it is surpassed only by the record-breaking Squid Game. With nearly 3 billion hours viewed worldwide, exictement for the last season is huge.</p>
